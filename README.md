# Gamification-Causal-Impact-Analysis

This project investigates the causal impact of integrating gamification elements into educational processes. Using a data-driven approach, we analyze how gamification affects students' academic performance, engagement levels, and overall Return on Investment (ROI) in a learning environment.

## Project Overview
The study compares two groups of students:

Gamification Group (Users): Students who engaged with gamified features.

Control Group (Non-Users): Students who followed a traditional learning path.

The analysis focuses on the transition from practice exams to final exams, measuring the "Score Improvement" as a primary KPI.

## Key Achievements & Findings

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values in practice exams using median imputation and consolidated system engagement metrics (No_access_Q1-6) into a single Total_Accesses feature.


Performance Surge: Initial analysis shows that students using gamification demonstrated a 60.2% higher improvement in final grades compared to the control group.


Engagement Tracking: Created a robust ROI report mapping the correlation between system interaction frequency and final academic success.

## Tech Stack
Python 3.x

Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning and numerical transformations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For high-quality statistical data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development and reporting environment.
